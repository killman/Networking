INSTALL
=======

PRE-REQUISITES
--------------
=> Squid2 >= v2.7 (yet not ported for Squid3)
For better results, Squid must be compiled with --enable-http-violations directive.

Some versions may present problems. Read important.txt before install.

INSTALL
----------

1. Put file inComum in /usr/lib/squid and inComum.conf in /etc/squid/

# cp ./inComum /usr/lib/squid/
# cp ./inComum.conf /etc/squid/

2. Make it runnable

# chmod +x /usr/lib/squid/inComum

3. Change owner to the same squid runner (usually proxy.proxy):

# chown proxy.proxy /usr/lib/squid/inComum
# chown proxy.proxy /etc/squid/inComum.conf

4. Configure inComum.conf

For now, you may change the following options:
-storeurl_rewrite_children
-maximum_object_size

5. Install helper on squid.conf

To install add following line (without #) on squid.conf:

include /etc/squid/inComum.conf

IMPORTANT: above line MUST be inserted BEFORE any other config.
(Not exactly: must be before acl QUERY or any other refresh_pattern).
